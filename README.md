# ShapeIt  

**ShapeIt** is a 3D modeler built on top of [CADability](https://github.com/FriendsOfCADability/CADability), an open-source CAD kernel developed in the same GitHub organization.  

ShapeIt provides the **user interface** and **modeling logic** for creating and editing 3D geometry. The application focuses on an interface that is **simple and intuitive**, making it accessible while still being powerful for advanced use cases.  

## Key Features
- Based on the **CADability** open-source project  
- Clean and intuitive user interface for 3D modeling  
- Fully implemented in **C#** on **.NET 8**  
- 100% open source  

## Project Status
ShapeIt is a **work in progress**. While it already offers a usable modeling environment, several major goals are planned for the future:
- A **scripting language** to automate modeling workflows  
- **Cross-platform support** through [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) (currently ShapeIt runs only on Windows)  

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! Whether it’s bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests, your input helps ShapeIt evolve into a more complete and flexible modeling tool.
